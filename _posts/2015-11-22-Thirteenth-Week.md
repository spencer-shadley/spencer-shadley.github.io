The last project is over!!!!! Object Oriented Programming projects have come to a close with the end of our fifth project based on Conway’s Life simulation. Quite an interesting and fun project. This project truly tested our inheritance in C++ as well as our ability to handle memory leaks/pointers. Several interesting new programming paradigms came about to me for the first time. For example, I had never actually coded an abstract class before and this gave me much more insight into good design practices for an abstract class. Both a blessing and curse, the ability to create AbstractCells which a Fredkin and Conway Cell inherit from was integral to the project. Another interesting piece of the project was wrapping the board of cells with a border/mote which allowed us to avoid bounds checking entirely. Finally, we discussed the differences between a virtual method and a pure virtual method and were required to implement at least one of each in the project. This split of virtual methods was something I had not heard of and found quite interesting. I do not know of a Java equivalent but it would be nice to do something similar within Java.

We also further discussed dynamic binding versus static binding, when that occurs and the benefits of each. Implementing a Shape class helped to drive home the dynamic binding example. Finally, we discussed Java’s reflection which is a really cool way to create a class based on given input. C++ apparently does not support this but we will be building it in future classes.

<strong>Tip of the week</strong>
Make <strong>sure</strong> to test your programs in the environment it will be used often. For this project my partner and I developed on Windows with Visual Studio the entire time until the last day at which point everything exploded. Apparently the GCC compiler and Visual Studio compiler disagree about some things and caused some insane headaches at the very end.
