### Pointers, References, Aliases and Hackathons
Another week comes and goes for Object Oriented Programming. This week, lecture focused primarily on the intricacies of data manipulation in C/C++. We discussed the various differences between pointers, references and aliases whilst also describing their impact on code. Although these can each solve the same problem set, by using the correct type you can move errors from runtime into compile time which are much easier to fix. We also briefly discussed operator overloading in C++. A fun activity we were allowed to do after learning about pointers and references was to write a pre_inc and post_inc function that mimic ++x and x++.

*Side note: after finishing this activity a bit early I practiced drawing & and my notes are now covered in about 100 &s.*

### Project
Our new project is due this Thursday and we spent a class discussing cool approaches to solving the problem. Essentially we are building the Australian voting system where people will vote for the candidates in order of preference. This seemingly simplistic problem has become vastly more complex than expected with segfaults becoming commonplace in my life once again. Luckily I have a great partner and we are chugging along through the project at a good pace. With every project in computer science I find that I am tricked more and more by deceitfully difficult projects with a nice pretty cover.

#### Tip of the week
Participate in hackathons! They serve as great interview practice, often come with free food/swag and are just fun to do! There is a hackathon with the Competitive Programming group sponsored by ACM every other Friday and anyone is welcome to join.
