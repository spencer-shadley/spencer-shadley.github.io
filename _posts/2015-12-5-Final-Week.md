<strong>The Course</strong><br>
Object Oriented Programming has sadly come to an end. This was an incredible course and I have learned more in this class than in any of my others while at UT. The subject matter itself was interesting and useful in both interviews and the industry. Ironically, I learned almost nothing about object oriented programming, however. In data structures object oriented programming was covered extensively while, contrastingly, in Downing’s course we only spent less than 10% of our time discussing OOP in any way. Do not take the course if that is all you would like to learn. However, after taking this course, I believe I know more C++ than the vast majority of people I have spoken with and am much more prepared for interviews. We learned about the fine-grained details on the latest and greatest in C++ (even && values). The projects truly formalized our C++ knowledge and the test format was purely writing C++ code which better reflects your ability to code than other courses test procedures.

<strong>The Professor</strong><br>
This was my first course with Downing and I believe he made more of an impact on the course than the subject itself. I am not sure how much this course differs from Downing’s additional offering named “Software Engineering” but I feel as though I learned quite a bit about software engineering in OOP. There were a plethora of tools required on the projects that are quite helpful in industry and interviews (these tools range from the standard GitHub to Travis CI.)
<br><br>
<strong>The Future</strong><br>
If my schedule allows it I will take Software Engineering simply because Downing has a teaching style that is incredibly clear with beneficial non-theoretical content. I would highly recommend Downing as a professor and OOP as a consequence of that. I think it would be a shame to graduate from UT without having taken at least one Downing class.

<strong>Note to Downing</strong><br>
You made a fantastic course and I would recommend it in a heartbeat. However, there are several grading changes I would suggest. The primary concern I have is regarding quizzes. I was absent due to interviews quite a lot and that was detrimental to my grade (right now it looks like it will likely cost me my A, being replaced with a B.) There should be a number of acceptable absences which then drop some number of quizzes from the grade (last semester I understand they dropped 8 quizzes). I think it is unfair to penalize the students who received out-of-town/all-day interviews or were sick.

<strong>Tip of the Week</strong><br>
Don’t take easy courses to merely receive your degree. Being at such an esteemed university gives you the ability to actually learn from your courses. Be willing to suffer through at least a course or two to receive a full education.
