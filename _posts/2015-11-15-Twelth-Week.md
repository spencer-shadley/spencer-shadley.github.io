Yet another busy week in my insane semester. More interviews and more object oriented programming. Second midterms kicked off, more final round fly-out interviews, projects circulating, data management growing and object oriented programming’s final project.
<br><br>
There was a variety of new C++ tools added to the object oriented programming’s students this week. We now understand how to require any type of value in our parameter list for functions/methods. This includes l-value, const l-value and now the new r-value (&&). This is handy for method overloading to handle anything a user can throw at us. We also learned about dynamic/static binding and how it can be useful or detrimental to our programs. We also learned about inlining programs which allows a function to be placed inline avoid the nasty overhead of jumps and message passing if the function is small enough.
<br><br>
Our final project is Conway’s game of life. This is the first project where we are allowed (and required) to implement inheritance. We have a Cell class wrapper for an abstract class called AbstractCell as well as two classes called ConwayCell and FredkinCell which inherit from AbstractCell. So far my partner and I have just designed the class structure (members and methods) which took much more time than in previous projects. I have notice that with each project the planning phase takes longer.

<strong>Tip of the week</strong>
When programming, keep in mind that you typically can sacrifice one of three items to make one or both of the other two items improve: time, space or code complexity.
