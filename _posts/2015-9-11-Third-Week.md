Another interesting week of Object Oriented Programming has come to pass. The first project (Collatz) was due and in terms of schedule, this week differed greatly from the norm due to Labor Day and a guest speaker. Labor Day was on Monday, meaning that we did not hold class. On Wednesday, Chris Martin from Bloomberg gave a guest lecture. Chris discussed what Bloomberg is like as a company and it greatly differed from my prior understanding of Bloomberg. Although Bloomberg is typically seen as some type of media outlet it turns out they are also a large financial type institution transferring billions of dollars and have a more extensive technology stack than I realized. Chris also discussed general advice in regards to recruiting/interviewing of which I have already incorporated some of into my resume. On Friday, how to handle errors historically and today were discussed. The archaic methods of setting global flags, returning error codes and passing arguments which are to be altered in case of error are finally (mostly) behind us. Now we have the ability to throw an exception. These exceptions are a much cleaner way of handling errors. After the somewhat un-reactionary students jotted down these notes we finally heard Downing’s infamous “It’s the high point of the goddamn class!” quote.

Our first project has come to pass and I learned a lot from it. Despite the actual coding being minimal and relatively easy, the project was somewhat difficult due to the plethora of new tools that we were required to implement such as Travis CI and Google Test. I am excited to begin the next project which will likely be more programmatically intensive and allow us to work in partners.

<strong>Tip of the Week</strong>
<br>
Don’t let yourself become irrelevant by using what you are comfortable in to solve everything. Try to use the things you don’t know or understand to solve your problems so that your toolbelt doesn’t become dated.
