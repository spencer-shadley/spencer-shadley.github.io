title: Eighth Week

OOP and interviews pervade my week yet again! My time is still being divvied between interviewing with companies and learned awesome new concepts in Object Oriented Programming. The interviews have picked up to such a degree that who I had originally decided to pair up with and I decided to solo the project purely for scheduling around these rampant interviews. With that, our third project (and my first solo project) begins! In this project, we are asked to build an allocator that will decide on memory space (allocation and destruction/freeing). The project somewhat mimics another project from my Operating Systems course and should provide better insight into how C++ allocates memory so that I can better write programs to take advantage of its memory allocation.
<br>Monday’s lecture delved into the details of the project and what will be required to complete the project (construct, destruct, allocate, deallocate, index and extra things of our choosing). Discussing this gave rise to a more general topic where programmers can opt to create policy patterns that would be available as APIs to other developers. The policy patterns in C++ are quite powerful and something that even Java does not support. With this, we can choose to allow even the standard vector class to use our custom allocator rather than the default built-in one. Quite powerful indeed! Unfortunately, I could not attend Wednesday’s lecture due to an interview conflict. On Friday we discussed how to implement vector which, again, gave further insight into how standard classes and iterators work in C++.

<strong>Tip of the week</strong><br>
Make sure to prioritize your work and school justly. A huge part of school is to get a great job at the end so sometimes it’s okay to sacrifice a bit of your grade to prepare for interviews.
