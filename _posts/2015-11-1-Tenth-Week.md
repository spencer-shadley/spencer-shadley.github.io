title: Tenth Week
---

This was one of the busiest weeks I have ever experienced! I was flown out for interviews, completed another object oriented programming project, completed another project, had two midterms, wrote two three page essays and completed several additional interviews and applications. 
<br><br>
Inside of the object oriented programming classes we re-implemented vector better than ever (this is the third implementation of vector). We also further discussed function overloading and its implications on our newest implementation of vector. We overloaded methods so that we can specifically handle l-values, constant l-values and actual r-values using the C++ 11 &&. With vector we had to be especially careful regarding the atrocious automatically generated methods, constructor and destructor which caused memory issues to be rampant.
<br><br>
In the object oriented programming project I learned much more about how classes should interact and was careful when designing our initial design (despite this we still changed an abundance of setups). In particular, we spent significant time ensuring our encapsulation (data hiding) was setup in the best way with the code still being functional. Surprisingly one of the most difficult parts of this project came at the very end. Despite using a seeded random value with value zero, our output differed from some of the other students. It was quite difficult to pinpoint the miniscule details which caused my partner and I’s output to differ from the other students in the class. At the very end I learned about UML diagrams which was fun to represent my code in such a way, I can see many practical uses coming from something like that such as sharing our code’s design/interaction.

<strong>Tip of the week</strong>
Rather than brute force coding, it is oftentimes easier and faster to continually break up a project into smaller and smaller more manageable chunks then implementing from there.
