title: Fifth Week
---

Enque object oriented practices and interviews! This week is often seen as career week with the career fair taking place on Monday and a plethora of interviews following. This makes this part of the semester quite difficult to balance with school and career simultaneously taking place. We have finally begun to delve into object oriented principles! Prior to this week we (necessarily) primarily discussed C++ and general programming practices such as how to handle errors (exceptions, asserts, etc.) but this week we specifically began learning how to generalize functions in order to apply object oriented principles and practices later. With the second project over we currently do not have a project to work on and are likely expected to be studying for the upcoming first exam in two weeks. Going back to the object oriented principles we are learning, iterators of varying types have been explained (the five iterators and their abilities in C++ which consist of Input Iterator, Output Iterator, Forward Iterator, Bidirectional Iterator and Random Iterator).

In addition to iterators, we learned about templating! With templates we can generalize functions to accept varying types which is absolutely awesome! Another awesome new technique we learning is lambda functions. Essentially in-line functions I learned how to take advantage of lambda functions and discovered that I had apparently been unknowingly using them in my JavaScript for quite some time.

From here on out I think incredible things will begin to take place. Object Oriented Programming will begin to flesh out, interviews will take place and my future will become much more solidified.

<strong>Tip of the week</strong>
Balance your career and education intelligently. It is important to do well in school but donâ€™t forget one of the main functions of school is to get a good job in the first place!
