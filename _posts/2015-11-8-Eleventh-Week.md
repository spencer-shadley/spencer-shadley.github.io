title: First Week

Darwin, oh Darwin, how you stressed my partner and I out. The Darwin project was due this week and although it was quite useful and fun to implement due to interviews and midterms it was a bit difficult to finish on time. This project, in my opinion, was the first project to demonstrate object oriented principles. There was a large focus spent on how to best encapsulate the data within different classes. Figuring out the best data hiding approach without killing ourselves in the code was a bit tricky and took a lot of planning as well as some give and take. There was no perfect solution that we came up with, everything had its own benefits and pains. Interestingly, in an interview I had yesterday I was asked to implement the class structure for chess. I wound up using essentially the same scheme for this question as the Darwin board (since a pawn can change type I made that a member of a Piece class just like the Species in Darwin).

The next project is now looming ahead of us, a project called Life. This project will be based on Conwayâ€™s Life but other than that I know nothing about the project. This will be the final project of the semester and I am excited to apply more object oriented principles (hopefully some inheritance!) to the project.

<strong>Tip of the week</strong>
Test driven development can be incredibly useful in a situation where you know the expected output. When you are unsure what the expected output is and are still contorting the question to fit your needs, test driven development may not be the best fit for you.
